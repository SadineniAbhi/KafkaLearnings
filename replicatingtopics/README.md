Theses modules in replicatingtopics package is used to replicate topic 

My solution for the Problem 
     
     create 2 topics from cli (A,B) (anything is fine but be sure to rename topic names in the code)
     write messages into one topic A
     consume and write messages to topic B
     consume messages from topic B
